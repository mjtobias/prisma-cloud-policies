  "description": "CloudFront, a content delivery network (CDN) offered by AWS, is not using a secure cipher for distribution. It is a best security practice to enforce the use of secure ciphers TLSv1.0, TLSv1.1, and/or TLSv1.2 in a CloudFront Distribution's certificate configuration. This policy scans for any deviations from this practice and returns the results.",
