Monitoring changes to CloudTrail's configuration will help ensure sustained visibility to activities performed in the AWS account. It is recommended that a metric filter and alarm be established for detecting changes to CloudTrail's configurations.\n\nNOTE: This policy will trigger alert if you have at least one Cloudtrail with the multi trial is enabled, Logs all management events in your account and is not set with specific log metric filter and alarm.",
