  "description": "This policy identifies user-managed service account keys which are not rotated from last 90 days or more. Rotating Service Account keys will reduce the window of opportunity for an access key that is associated with a compromised or terminated account to be used. Service Account keys should be rotated to ensure that data cannot be accessed with an old key which might have been lost, cracked, or stolen. It is recommended that all user-managed service account keys are regularly rotated.",
