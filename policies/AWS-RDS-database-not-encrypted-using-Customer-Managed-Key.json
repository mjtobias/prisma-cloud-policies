  "description": "This policy identifies RDS databases that are encrypted with default KMS keys and not with customer managed keys. As a best practice, use customer managed keys to encrypt the data on your RDS databases and maintain control of your keys and data on sensitive workloads.",

  "recommendation": "Because you can set AWS RDS database encryption only during database creation, the process for resolving this alert requires you to â€” create a new RDS database with a customer managed key for encryption, migrate the data from the reported database to this newly created database, and delete the RDS database identified in the alert.\n\nTo create a new RDS database with encryption using a customer managed key:\n1. Log in to the AWS console.\n2. Select the region for which the alert was generated.\n3. Navigate to the Amazon RDS Dashboard.\n4. Select 'Create database'.\n5. On the 'Select engine' page, select 'Engine options' and 'Next'.\n6. On the 'Choose use case' page, select 'Use case' of database and 'Next'.\n7. On the 'Specify DB details' page, specify the database details you need and click 'Next'.\nNote: Amazon RDS encryption has some limitation on region and type instances. For Availability of Amazon RDS Encryption refer to: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Overview.Encryption.html#Overview.Encryption.Availability\n8. On the 'Configure advanced settings' page, Under 'Encryption', select 'Enable encryption' and select the customer managed key [i.e. Other than (default)aws/rds] from 'Master key' dropdown list].\n9. Select 'Create database'.\n\nTo delete the RDS database that uses the default KMS keys, which triggered the alert:\n1. Log in to the AWS console\n2. Select the region for which the alert was generated.\n3. Navigate to the Amazon RDS Dashboard.\n4. Click on Instances, and select the reported RDS database.\n5. Select the 'Instance actions' drop-down and click 'Delete'.\n7. In the 'Delete' dialog, select the 'Create final snapshot?' checkbox, if you want a backup. Provide a name for the final snapshot, confirm deletion and select 'Delete'.",
