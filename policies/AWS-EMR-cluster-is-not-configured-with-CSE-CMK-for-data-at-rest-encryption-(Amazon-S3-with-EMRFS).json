As a best practice, use Customer Master Keys (CMK) to encrypt the data in your EMR cluster and ensure full control over your data.",

In 'Name' box, provide a name for the new EMR security configuration.\n7. For encryption At Rest click the checkbox for 'Enable at-rest encryption for EMRFS data in Amazon S3'.\n8. From the dropdown 'Default encryption modeâ€™ select 'CSE-Custom'. Follow below link for configuration steps.\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-encryption-enable.html\n9. Click on 'Create' button\n10. On the left menu of EMR dashboard Click 'Clusters'\n11.

On the Create Cluster page, in the Security Options section, click on 'security configuration'\n14. From the 'Security configuration' drop down select the name of the security configuration created at step 4 to step 8, click 'Create Cluster'\n15. Once you the new cluster is set up verify its working and terminate the source cluster in order to stop incurring charges for it.\n16. On the left menu of EMR dashboard Click 'Clusters', from the list of clusters select the source cluster which is alerted\n17. Click on the 'Terminate' button from the top menu.\n18.
