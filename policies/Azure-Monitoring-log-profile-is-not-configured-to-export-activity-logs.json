  "description": "This policy identifies the Azure accounts in which at least one monitoring log profile is not configured. A Log Profile controls how your Activity Log is exported; using which you could export the logs and store them for a longer duration for analyzing security activities within your Azure account. So it is recommended to have at least one monitoring log profile in an account to export all activity logs.",
