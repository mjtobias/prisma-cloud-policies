  "description": "This policy identifies Azure Virtual Machines (VMs) that do not have endpoint protection installed. Installing endpoint protection systems (like Antimalware for Azure) provides for real-time protection capability that helps identify and remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. As a best practice, install endpoint protection on all VMs and computers to help identify and remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software.",
