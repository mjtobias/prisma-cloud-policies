  "description": "This policy identifies Azure Network Security Groups (NSG) that allow all traffic on FTP-Data (TCP Port 20). Review your list of NSG rules to ensure that your resources are not exposed. As a best practice, restrict FTP-Data solely to known static IP addresses. Limit the access list to include known hosts, services, or specific employees only.",
