AWS provides a reasonable starting limitation for the maximum number of Virtual private gateways you can assign in each VPC. If you approach the limit in a particular VPC, this alert indicates that you have nearly exhausted your allocation.\nNOTE: As per http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html Virtual private gateway per region limit is 5. This policy will trigger an alert if Virtual private gateway per region reached 80% (i.e. 4) of resource availability limit allocated.",
