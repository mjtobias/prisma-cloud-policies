  "name": "AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) with ACM certificate expiring in 90 days",
  "description": "This policy identifies Elastic Load Balancers (ELB) which are using ACM certificates expiring in 90 days or using expired certificates. AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) is the preferred tool to provision, manage, and deploy your server certificates. With ACM you can request a certificate or deploy an existing ACM or external certificate to AWS resources. As a best practice, it is recommended to reimport expiring certificates while preserving the ELB associations of the original certificate.",
