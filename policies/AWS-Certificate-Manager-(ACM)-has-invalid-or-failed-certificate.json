  "description": "This policy identifies certificates in ACM which are either in Invalid or Failed state. If the ACM certificate is not validated within 72 hours, it becomes Invalid. An ACM certificate fails when,\n- the certificate is requested for invalid public domains\n- the certificate is requested for domains which are not allowed missing contact information\n- typographical errors\nIn such cases (Invalid or Failed certificate), you will have to request for a new certificate. It is strongly recommended to delete the certificates which are in failed or invalid state.",
