  "description": "This policy identifies Azure Network Security Groups (NSG) that allow all traffic on SQL Server (UDP Port 1434). Review your list of NSG rules to ensure that your resources are not exposed. As a best practice, restrict SQL Server solely to known static IP addresses. Limit the access list to include known hosts, services, or specific employees only.",
