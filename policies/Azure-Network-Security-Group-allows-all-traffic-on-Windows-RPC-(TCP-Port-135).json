  "description": "This policy identifies Azure Network Security Groups (NSG) that allow all traffic on Windows RPC (TCP Port 135). Review your list of NSG rules to ensure that your resources are not exposed. As a best practice, restrict Windows RPC solely to known static IP addresses. Limit the access list to include known hosts, services, or specific employees only.",
