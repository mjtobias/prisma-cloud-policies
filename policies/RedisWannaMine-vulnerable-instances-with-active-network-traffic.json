  "description": "RedisWannaMine is cryptojacking attack which aims at both database servers and application servers via remote code execution, exploiting an Apache Struts vulnerability. To inject cryptocurrency mining malware, RedWannaMine uses a transmission control protocol (TCP) scanner to check open port 445 of SMB and scans vulnerable Redis server database over port 6379(tcp), so that it can use EternalBlue to spread further.",
