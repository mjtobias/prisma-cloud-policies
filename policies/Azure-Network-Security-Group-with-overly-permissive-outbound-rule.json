  "description": "This policy identifies NSGs with overly permissive outbound rules allowing outgoing traffic from source type any or source with public IP range. A network security group contains a list of security rules that allow or deny inbound or outbound network traffic based on source or destination IP address, port, and protocol. As a best practice, it is recommended to configure NSGs to restrict traffic to known sources on authorized protocols and ports.",
