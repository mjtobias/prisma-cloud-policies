  "description": "API Gateway can generate an SSL certificate and use its public key in the backend to verify that HTTP requests to your backend system are from API Gateway. This allows your HTTP backend to control and accept only requests originating from Amazon API Gateway, even if the backend is publicly accessible.\n\nNote: Some backend servers may not support SSL client authentication as API Gateway does and could return an SSL certificate error. For a list of incompatible backend servers, see Known Issues. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-known-issues.html",

If not please generate a client certificate by following below steps and then Configure an API to Use SSL Certificates.\nSteps to Generate a Client Certificate Using the API Gateway Console:\n1. Login to AWS Console\n2. Go to API Gateway console\n3. In the main navigation pane (Left Panel), choose Client Certificates.\n4. From the Client Certificates pane, choose Generate Client Certificate.\n5. Optionally, for Edit, choose to add a descriptive title for the generated certificate and choose Save to save the description. API Gateway generates a new certificate and returns the new certificate GUID, along with the PEM-encoded public key.\n\nSteps to Configure an API to Use SSL Certificates:\n1. Login to AWS Console\n2. Go to API Gateway console\n3. In the API Gateway console, create or open an API for which you want to use the client certificate. Make sure the API has been deployed to a stage (Left Panel).\n4. Choose Stages under the selected API and then choose a stage (Left Panel).\n5. In the Stage Editor panel, select a certificate under the Client Certificate section.\n6. Click Save Changes",
