  "description": "This policy identifies AWS instances with sensitive cloud workloads which are exposed to internet. AWS Cloud workloads should have appropriate Security Groups and ACLs in place so that only external facing workloads such as load balancers, web servers, bastion hosts are exposed to the internet. Cloud workloads with internet exposure are vulnerable to external threats.\n\nNote: This policy alerts AWS workloads correctly and for Azure and GCP this policy could trigger FP for NAT Gateway and ELB configured resources",

  "recommendation": "1. Login to the AWS Cloud Console\n2. Navigate to the service for which the resource is reported\n3. Check to see if the security group for the resource indeed allows connections from internet.\n4. Assign another security group to the resource that has more restrictive ACL which does not permit connection from internet.\n\nNote: This policy recommendation is for AWS resources only",
