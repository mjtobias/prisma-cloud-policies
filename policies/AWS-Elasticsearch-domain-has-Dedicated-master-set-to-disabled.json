  "description": "This policy identifies Elasticsearch domains for which Dedicated master is disabled in your AWS account. If dedicated master nodes are provided those handle the management tasks and cluster nodes can easily manage index and search requests from different types of workload and make them more resilient in production. Dedicated master nodes improve environmental stability by freeing all the management tasks from the cluster data nodes.",
