  "description": "This policy identifies the GCP accounts which do not have a log metric filter and alert for VPC Network Firewall rule changes. Monitoring for Create or Update firewall rule events gives insight network access changes and may reduce the time it takes to detect suspicious activity. It is recommended to create a metric filter and alarm to detect VPC Network Firewall rule changes.",
