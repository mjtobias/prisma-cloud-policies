  "description": "This policy identifies the GCP account which does not have a log metric filter and alert for IAM custom role changes. Monitoring role creation, deletion and updating activities will help in identifying over-privileged roles at early stages. It is recommended to create a metric filter and alarm to detect activities related to the creation, deletion and updating of custom IAM Roles.",
