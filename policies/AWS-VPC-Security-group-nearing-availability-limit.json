  "description": "This policy identifies VPCs which are nearing availability limit of Security groups. AWS provides a reasonable starting limitation for the maximum number of VPC security groups you can assign in each VPC. If you approach the limit in a particular VPC, you have nearly exhausted your allocation. As a best practice, it is recommended to remove Security groups that are not associated or not used, it will also help you avoid unexpected charges on your bill.\nNOTE: As per https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/amazon-vpc-limits.html. On the date, VPC Security groups per region limit is 2500. This policy will trigger an alert if VPC Security groups per region reached 80% (i.e. 2000) of resource availability limit allocated. If you need more Security groups in a VPC, You can contact AWS for a service limit increase.",
