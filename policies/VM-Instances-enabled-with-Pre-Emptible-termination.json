  "description": "Checks to verify if any VM instance is initiated with the flag 'Pre-Emptible termination' set to True. Setting this instance to True implies that this VM instance will shut down within 24 hours or can also be terminated by a Service Engine when high demand is encountered. While this might save costs, it can also lead to unexpected loss of service when the VM instance is terminated.",
