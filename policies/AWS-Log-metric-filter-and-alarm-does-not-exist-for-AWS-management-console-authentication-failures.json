  "name": "AWS Log metric filter and alarm does not exist for AWS management console authentication failures",
  "description": "This policy identifies the AWS accounts which do not have a log metric filter and alarm for AWS management console authentication failures. Monitoring failed console logins may decrease lead time to detect an attempt to brute force a credential, which may provide an indicator, such as source IP, that can be used in other event correlation. It is recommended that a metric filter and alarm be established for failed console authentication attempts.\n\nNOTE: This policy will trigger alert if you have at least one Cloudtrail with the multi trial is enabled, Logs all management events and is not set with specific log metric filter and alarm in your account.",
