  "name": "AWS EC2 instances with Public IP and associated with Security Groups have Internet Access",
  "description": "This policy identifies AWS EC2 instances with Public IP and associated with Security Groups have Internet Access. EC2 instance receives a public IP address when launched in a default VPC security group (A security group acts as a virtual firewall for your instance to control inbound and outbound traffic.) and we don't assign a public IP address to instances launched in a non-default subnet. Therefore it's a best practice to ensure that there are no EC2 instances with Public IP that are associated with Security Groups which have Internet Access.",
