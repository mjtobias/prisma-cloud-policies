  "description": "This policy identifies the GCP account which does not have a log metric filter and alert for VPC network route changes. Monitoring network routes deletion and insertion activities will help in identifying VPC traffic flows through an expected path. It is recommended to create a metric filter and alarm to detect activities related to the deletion and insertion of VPC network routes.",
