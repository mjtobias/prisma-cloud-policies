  "description": "RDS Retention Policies for Backups are an important part of your DR/BCP strategy. Recovering data from catastrophic failures, malicious attacks, or corruption often requires a several day window of potentially good backup material to leverage. As such, the best practice is to ensure your RDS clusters are retaining at least 7 days of backups, if not more (up to a maximum of 35).",
