  "description": "This policy identifies the AWS regions which do not have a log metric filter and alarm for S3 bucket policy changes. Monitoring changes to S3 bucket policies may reduce time to detect and correct permissive policies on sensitive S3 buckets. It is recommended that a metric filter and alarm be established for changes to S3 bucket policies.\n\nNOTE: This policy will trigger alert if you have at least one Cloudtrail with the multi trial is enabled, Logs all management events in your account and is not set with specific log metric filter and alarm.",
