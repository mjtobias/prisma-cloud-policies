  "description": "Audit Logs can help you find suspicious events, unusual activity, and trends. Auditing the SQL server, at the server-level, allows you to track all existing and newly created databases on the instance.\n\nThis policy identifies SQL servers which do not retain audit logs for more than 90 days. As a best practice, configure the audit logs retention time period to be greater than 90 days.",
