  "description": "TracingConfig is a property of the AWS::Lambda::Function resource that configures tracing settings for your AWS Lambda (Lambda) function. When enabled, AWS Lambda tracing acitivates AWS X-Ray service that collects information on requests that a specific function performed. It reduces the time and effort for debugging and diagnosing the errors.\n\nThe value can be either PassThrough or Active. If PassThrough, Lambda will only trace the request from an upstream service if it contains a tracing header with 'sampled=1'. If Active, Lambda will respect any tracing header it receives from an upstream service. If no tracing header is received, Lambda will call X-Ray for a tracing decision.",
