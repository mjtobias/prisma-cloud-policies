  "description": "This policy identifies IAM users which have overly permissive service account privileges. Any user should not have Service Account Admin and Service Account User, both roles assigned at a time. Built-in/Predefined IAM role Service Account admin allows the user to create, delete, manage service accounts. Built-in/Predefined IAM role Service Account User allows the user to assign service accounts to Apps/Compute Instances. It is recommended to follow the principle of 'Separation of Duties' ensuring that one individual does not have all the necessary permissions to be able to complete a malicious action or meant to help avoid security or privacy incidents and errors.",
