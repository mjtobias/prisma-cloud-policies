  "description": "This policy identifies your Amazon EC2 instances which have a scheduled event. AWS can schedule events for your instances, such as a reboot, stop/start, or retirement. These events do not occur frequently. If one of your instances will be affected by a scheduled event, AWS sends an email to the email address thatâ€™s associated with your AWS account prior to the scheduled event, with details about the event, including the start and end date. Depending on the event, you might be able to take action to control the timing of the event. If AWS scheduled event is planned for within 7 days, this signature triggers an alert.",
