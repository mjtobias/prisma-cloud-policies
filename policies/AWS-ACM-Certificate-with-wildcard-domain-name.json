  "name": "AWS ACM Certificate with wildcard domain name",
  "description": "This policy identifies ACM Certificates which are using wildcard certificates for wildcard domain name instead of single domain name certificates. ACM allows you to use an asterisk (*) in the domain name to create an ACM Certificate containing a wildcard name that can protect several sites in the same domain. For example, a wildcard certificate issued for *.prismacloud.io can match both www.prismacloud.io and images.prismacloud.io. When you use wildcard certificates, if the private key of a certificate is compromised, then all domain and subdomains that use the compromised certificate are potentially impacted. So it is recommended to use single domain name certificates instead of wildcard certificates to reduce the associated risks with a compromised domain or subdomain.",
