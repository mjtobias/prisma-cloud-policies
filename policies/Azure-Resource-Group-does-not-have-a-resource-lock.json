  "description": "Azure Resource Manager locks provide a way to lock down Azure resources from being deleted or modified. The lock level can be set to either 'CanNotDelete' or 'ReadOnly'. When you apply a lock at a parent scope, all resources within the scope inherit the same lock, and the most restrictive lock takes precedence.\n\nThis policy identifies Azure Resource Groups that do not have a lock set. As a best practice, place a lock on important resources to prevent accidental or malicious modification or deletion by unauthorized users.",
