  "description": "Application-layer Secrets Encryption provides an additional layer of security for sensitive data, such as Secrets, stored in etcd. Using this functionality, you can use a key, that you manage in Cloud KMS, to encrypt data at the application layer. This protects against attackers who gain access to an offline copy of etcd.\n\nThis policy checks your cluster for the Application-layer Secrets Encryption security feature and alerts if it is not enabled.",
