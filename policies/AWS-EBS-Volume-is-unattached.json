Go to the AWS console EC2 dashboard.\n2. In the navigation pane, choose Volumes.\n3. Sort using the State column and locate the volumes marked 'available.'\n4. Review the volume information (create date, size, status, etc).\n5. Determine if you wish to retain or remove each volume.\n\nWe recommend taking the time to attach volumes to test instances so you can actively browse the content. While volume names and tags are often generic, the data on each volume will be highly informative as to the volume's previous use.",
