  "name": "Azure Network Security Group having Inbound rule overly permissive to all traffic on any protocol",
  "description": "This policy identifies Azure Network Security Groups (NSGs) which are overly permissive to all traffic on any protocol. A network security group contains a list of security rules that allow or deny inbound or outbound network traffic based on source or destination IP address, port, and protocol. As a best practice, it is recommended to configure NSGs to restrict traffic from known sources, allowing only authorized protocols and ports.",
