  "description": "This policy identifies ElastiCache Redis clusters which have encryption for data at rest(at-rest) is disabled. It is highly recommended to implement at-rest encryption in order to prevent unauthorized users from reading sensitive data saved to persistent media available on your Redis clusters and their associated cache storage systems.",

  "recommendation": "AWS ElastiCache Redis cluster at-rest encryption can be set only at the time of the creation of the cluster. So to fix this alert, create a new cluster with at-rest encryption, then migrate all required ElastiCache Redis cluster data from the reported ElastiCache Redis cluster to this newly created cluster and delete reported ElastiCache Redis cluster.\n\nTo create new ElastiCache Redis cluster with at-rest encryption set, perform the following:\n1. Sign into the AWS console\n2. In the console, select the specific region from region drop down on the top right corner, for which the alert is generated\n3. Navigate to ElastiCache Dashboard\n4. Click on Redis\n5. Click on 'Create' button\n6. On the 'Create your Amazon ElastiCache cluster' page,\na. Select 'Redis' cache engine type.\nb. Enter a name for the new cache cluster\nc. Select Redis engine version from 'Engine version compatibility' dropdown list.\nNote: As of July 2018, In-transit encryption can be enabled only for AWS ElastiCache clusters with Redis engine version 3.2.6 and 4.0.10.\nd. Click on 'Advanced Redis settings' to expand the cluster advanced settings panel\ne. Select 'Encryption at-rest' checkbox to enable encryption along with other necessary parameters\n7. Click on 'Create' button to launch your new ElastiCache Redis cluster\n\nTo delete reported ElastiCache Redis cluster, perform the following:\n1. Sign into the AWS console\n2. In the console, select the specific region from region drop down on the top right corner, for which the alert is generated\n3. Navigate to ElastiCache Dashboard\n4. Click on Redis\n5. Select reported Redis cluster\n6. Click on 'Delete' button\n7. In the 'Delete Cluster' dialog box, if you want a backup for your cluster select 'Yes' from the 'Create final backup' dropdown menu, provide a name for the cluster backup, then click on 'Delete'.",
